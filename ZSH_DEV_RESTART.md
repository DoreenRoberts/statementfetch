# Development Environment Setup - SUCCESS ✅

## Node.js Installation Confirmed
- ✅ Node.js: v22.18.0
- ✅ npm: v10.9.3

## Next Steps to Run Your React App

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```
### 2. Verify Project Files
```bash
# Make sure you're in the correct project directory
pwd    # Shows current directory
ls     # Should show package.json and other project files
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (Required First Time)
```bash
# Install all project dependencies
npm install

# If you get errors, try clearing cache first:
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
# Start the React development server
npm run dev

# You should see output like:
#   VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms
#   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
#   ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### 5. Open in Browser
1. Copy the URL from terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173/`)
2. Open Safari and paste the EXACT URL
3. You should see your React app running

## What to Do Now
Please run these commands in order and let me know what output you see:

1. `pwd` (to confirm your location)
2. `ls` (to see if package.json exists)
3. `npm install` (to install dependencies)
4. `npm run dev` (to start the app)

Let me know what happens at each step!
